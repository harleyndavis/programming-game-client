## Playing the Game

Watch your character react as you change code at `https://programming-game.com/watch/<character>`, there are quicklinks for each of your characters in your [dashboard](https://programming-game.com/dashboard).

There's a basic [getting started guide](https://programming-game.com/docs/getting-started) that walks you through the most basic mechanics of the game. It's **highly** recommended that you work through this.

## Staying Connected

The game is designed to be played 24/7. It can be advantageous to deploy the game to a SAAS that allows you to run 24/7.

Some low cost providers:

- [fly.io](https://fly.io) - You can run a client on fly.io for less than $5/month.
- [heroku](https://heroku.com) - you can deploy a single dyno that stays connected for $5/month.
